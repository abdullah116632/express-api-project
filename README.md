# Express API Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **backend-only API** built with **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. It was developed as a learning exercise to explore **advanced topics in Express and Mongoose**, including **aggregation pipelines, advanced queries, and error handling**.

## 🎯 Features
- 🚀 **Advanced Express.js concepts**  
- 🗄️ **MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling**  
- 📊 **Aggregation Pipeline for data processing**  
- 🔍 **Advanced Query Filtering & Pagination**  
- 🔥 **Centralized Error Handling**  
- 🔑 **Authentication & Authorization (if implemented)**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Node.js & Express.js** (for backend server & routing)  
- **MongoDB Atlas** (for cloud database storage)  
- **Mongoose** (for schema modeling and data validation)  
- **Aggregation Pipeline** (for advanced data processing)  
- **Middleware** (for request handling & error management)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abdullah116632/express-api-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd express-api-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Add a `.env` file and set up:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-atlas-url
   PORT=5000
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
6. Test API endpoints using **Postman** or **cURL**.

## 📌 Future Improvements
